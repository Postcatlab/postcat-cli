# EO CLI

## Installion

```
npm install -g @eoapi/cli
```

Now, you can use `eo xxx` command to generate„ÄÅupload plugin of eoapi.

## Generate

```bash
eo generate <plugin name>
# or
eo g <plugin name>
# or
eo g <plugin name> [--type] <feature-push | feature-export>
```

The commad will generate a folder includes base config files, let you could create any features.

## Upload

```
eo upload <plugin package>
```

It will find and go inside the package directory, and upload the `package.json` to eopai market. However you need to wait until it is approved to find it in the market.

## Debug

```
eo debug <plugin package>
```

The command will create a link between eoapi with your extension. It seems like install your extension from the market, but you don't need to upload the extension. We are also planning to support hot-update.
